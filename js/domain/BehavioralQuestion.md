Customer Obsession

Leaders start with the customer and work backwards.They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust.Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.
    Ownership

Leaders are owners.They think long term and don’t sacrifice long - term value for short - term results.They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.They never say “that’s not my job."
Invent and Simplify

Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify.They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.
Are Right, A Lot

Leaders are right a lot.They have strong judgment and good instincts.They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.
Learn and Be Curious

Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves.They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.
Hire and Develop the Best

Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion.They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization.Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others.We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.
Insist on the Highest Standards

Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high.Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes.Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.
Think Big

Thinking small is a self - fulfilling prophecy.Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results.They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.s
