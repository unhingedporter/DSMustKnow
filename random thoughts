When the same 
#facts have different #meanings... A matter of #interpretation

#Data is often meaningless without #context. Data with context gives us #information.
We interpret that information to build #knowledge... And it is finally how we use this knowledge which is the most important process!

The same can apply to anything in #life, including how we view our #world ;-)
