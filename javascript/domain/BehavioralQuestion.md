Customer Obsession

Leaders start with the customer and work backwards.They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust.Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.
    Ownership

Leaders are owners.They think long term and don’t sacrifice long - term value for short - term results.They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.They never say “that’s not my job."
Invent and Simplify

Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify.They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.
Are Right, A Lot

Leaders are right a lot.They have strong judgment and good instincts.They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.
Learn and Be Curious

Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves.They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.
Hire and Develop the Best

Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion.They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization.Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others.We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.
Insist on the Highest Standards

Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high.Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes.Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.
Think Big

Thinking small is a self - fulfilling prophecy.Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results.They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.s

##### What do you do to stay motivated?
      
    * Why it’s effective: In terms of must-ask behavioral questions, this one might take the cake. In any job, staying motivated is key to avoiding burnout, sticking with the job, and delivering best results. If the candidate’s cause for motivation is likely to be volatile – like the constant hope of a promotion, or the ability to shape big company decisions, it may be cause for pause. In addition, if their source of motivation is tied to your company’s culture and values – like care for the environment, or providing excellent service to customers – it can be a sign they’re a good fit.
  
##### What is one project you're proud of?
    
    * Why it’s effective: This is one of the main chances during the interview for the candidate to shine. It gives them a chance to promote their work and the role they played in bringing that work to life. It’s also important to listen – how do they promote themselves? Do they give more credit to themselves or others? This question gives a window into both how the candidate works and promotes their work.

##### What is the biggest compliment you have received in your current role?

    * Why it’s effective: This is a much better twist to the questions “what is your greatest strength?” This grounds the candidate’s self-assessment in the real-world context of not only how well the performed in their current role, but what attracted other people notice and compliment. It is likely that what the candidate was appreciated for in their current role will similarly be an asset in their new role.

##### Tell me about a time that you had a disagreement with your manager.

    *   Why it’s effective: Just as there is a wide array of managerial styles, there is similarly a way of responding to different managerial styles. Some employees may jump to complete every task a manager mentions, while others may be more likely to challenge their manager and suggest areas for improvement. This question can sheds light on how the candidate will interact with their manager and resolve difficulties with them. When seeking to match a candidate with a certain manager or team, this is an invaluable question to determine their fit.
