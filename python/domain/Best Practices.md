# Best Practices of Python

## Minimum set

### README

    This is in the root directory too and is where you describe your project and what it does. You can write this in Markdown, reStructuredText, or plain text.

### Module Code

    This holds your actual code that may be inside a subdirectory or inside root.
    requirements.txt

    This is not mandatory, but if you use this, you put it in the root directory. Here, you mention the modules and dependencies of the project- the things it will not run without.

#### setup py

        This script in the root lets distutils build and distribute modules needed by the project.

#### Documentation

        Readable documentation is essential. This is placed in the docs directory.
        Defacto standard in python world for the purpose is 'Sphinx' library. 
        Always have DocStrings -
            -String as first statement of a module, function, class or method
            -Become the __doc__ attribute

#### Tests

        Most projects have tests- keep these in the tests directory.

### Create Readable Documentation

    You may find it burdensome, but it creates clean code. For this, you can use Markdown, reStructuredText, Sphinx, or docstrings. Markdown and reStructuredText are markup languages with plain text formatting syntax to make it easier to mark up text and convert it to a format like HTML or PDF. reStructuredText lets you create in-line documentation. And Sphinx is a tool to easily create intelligent and beautiful documentation. It lets you generate Python documentation from existing reStructuredText. It also lets you export documentation in formats like HTML. Docstrings are documentation strings at the beginning of each module, class, or method.

### Follow Style Guidelines

    The PEP8 holds some great community-generated proposals. PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposals- these are guidelines and standards for development. There are other PEPs like the PEP20, but PEP8 is the Python community bible for you if you want to properly style your code. This is to make sure all Python code looks and feels the same. One such guideline is to name classes with the CapWords convention.

    Use proper naming conventions for variables, functions, methods, and more.
    Variables, functions, methods, packages, modules: this_is_a_variable
    Classes and exceptions: CapWords
    Protected methods and internal functions: _single_leading_underscore
    Private methods: __double_leading_underscore
    Constants: CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES

    Use 4 spaces for indentation. For more conventions, refer to PEP8.

### Correct Broken Code Immediately

    Like with the broken code theory, correct your broken code immediately. If you let it be while you work on something else, it can lead to worse problems later. Always follows a ‘zero defects methodology’, and always corrects bugs and defects before proceeding.

### Use the PyPI Instead of Doing it Yourself

    One of the reasons behind Python’s popularity is the PyPI- this is the Python Package Index; it has more than multiple projects at the time of writing. This is a repository of software for Python and has thousands of Python projects. You should use code from this instead of writing it yourself- this saves time and lets you focus on the more important things. The PyPI has projects about everything, and you can install these using pip. You can also create and upload your own package here. Follow this best practice in Python, this will help you a lot.

### The Zen of Python

    Tim Peters wrote this short poem to express what values you should follow while coding in Python. You can get this by running “import this” in the IDLE:

        >>> import this

    The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren’t special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you’re Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea — let’s do more of those!

### Use the Right Data Structures

    Know the benefits and limitations of different data structures, and choose the right one for your code.

### Write Readable Code

    You should use line breaks and indent your code. Use naming conventions for identifiers- this makes it easier to understand the code. Use comments, and whitespaces around operators and assignments. Keep the maximum line length 79 characters. You should stay consistent and write readable code.

### Use Virtual Environments

    You should create a virtual environment for each project you create. This will avoid any library clashes, since different projects may need different versions of a certain library.

### Write Object-Oriented Code

    Python is an object-oriented language, and everything in Python is an object. You should use the object-oriented paradigm if writing code for Python. This has the advantages of data hiding and modularity. It allows reusability, modularity, polymorphism, data encapsulation, and inheritance. Also, you should write modular and non-repetitive code. Use classes and functions in your code.

## What Not to Do

    Avoid importing everything from a package- this pollutes the global namespace and can cause clashes. Don’t implement best practices from other languages. Don’t turn off error reporting during development- turn it off after it. Don’t alter sys.path, use distutils for that.

    Do not misuse dynamic typing ommision
