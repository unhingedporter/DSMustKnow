/*#Write a function to get the intersection point of two Linked Lists

#There are two singly linked lists in a system. By some programming error, the end node of one of the linked list got linked to the second list, forming an inverted Y shaped list. Write a program to get the point where two linked list merge. 



#Method 2 (Mark Visited Nodes)
#This solution requires modifications to basic linked list data structure. Have a visited flag with each node. Traverse the first linked list and keep marking visited nodes. Now traverse the second linked list, If you see a visited node again then there is an intersection point, return the intersecting node. This solution works in O(m+n) but requires additional information with each node. A variation of this solution that doesn’t require modification to the basic data structure can be implemented using a hash. Traverse the first linked list and store the addresses of visited nodes in a hash. Now traverse the second linked list and if you see an address that already exists in the hash then return the intersecting node.


#Method 7 (Use Hashing)
#Basically, we need to find a common node of two linked lists. So we hash all nodes of the first list and then check the second list.
#1) Create an empty hash set.
#2) Traverse the first linked list and insert all nodes’ addresses in the hash set.
#3) Traverse the second list. For every node check if it is present in the hash set. If we find a node in the hash set, return the node.
